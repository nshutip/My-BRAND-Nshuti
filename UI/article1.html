                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
                    pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
                    account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
                    explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one 
                    rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
                    but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
                    encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there 
                    anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, 
                    because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which 
                    toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
                    which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain 
                    some advantage from it?
